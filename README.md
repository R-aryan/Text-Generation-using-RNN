# Text Generation with Neural Networks

In this repository we will create a network that can generate text, here we show it being done character by character.

 A very awesome write up on text generation: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/

## About The Data

You can grab any free text you want from here: https://www.gutenberg.org/

We'll choose all of shakespeare's works (which we have already downloaded for you), mainly for two reasons:

1. Its a large corpus of text, its usually recommended you have at least a source of 1 million characters total to get realistic text generation.

2. It has a very distinctive style. Since the text data uses old style english and is formatted in the style of a stage play, it will be very obvious to us if the model is able to reproduce similar results.


## Inference

For Inference purpose the model/weights can be downloaded from here :-
